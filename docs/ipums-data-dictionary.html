      <b>Extract Notes: </b>
      User-provided description:  Household size extract for years 2000 and 2019 for household demography project. Includes basic demographics, PUMA, and some variables on house characteristics (# of bedrooms, house value, etc.). Also includes person-level and household-level replicate weights, as well as some additional characteristics on individuals, like their birthplace and education. Includes income level. Unlike previous sample, I've narrowed years to 2000 and 2019 and added tenure status (renter vs homeowner) and another variable or two.

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>SAMPLE identifies the IPUMS sample from which the case is drawn. Each sample receives a unique 6-digit code. The codes are structured as follows:</p>
            <p>The first four digits are the year of the census/survey.</p>
            <p>The next two digits identify the sample within the year.
For most censuses, IPUMS has multiple datasets which were constructed using different sampling techniques (i.e. size/demographic of the sample population, geographic coverage level or location, or duration of the sampling period for the ACS/PRCS samples).  </p>
            <p>The availability table for each variable indicates whether that variable is available in only certain samples for a given year. For further discussion of sample differences, see "Sample Designs.".</p>
            <p>Note: SAMPLE replaces DATANUM. Though the last two digits in SAMPLE do not correlate exactly with the now-deprecated DATANUM, the variable serves the same purpose of assigning a unique id to all cases that belong to the same dataset.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>PUMA identifies the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) where the housing unit was located. PUMAs are the smallest geographic units identified in Public Use Microdata Samples since 1990 for both the decennial censuses and the ACS/PRCS. To help maintain the confidentiality of respondents in public use microdata, every PUMA must, by design, have at least 100,000 residents at the time of the corresponding census. </p>
            <p>IPUMS has also created PUMAs for the 1960 5% sample, which each correspond approximately to one or more 2000 PUMAs using a minimum population threshold of 50,000.</p>
            <p>Note: PUMA codes are state-dependent. The PUMA codes for 1990 and later samples are unique only within each state, so a single code may identify different PUMAs in different states. To uniquely identify all PUMAs, it is necessary to combine the PUMA variable with a state identifier (STATEFIP or STATEICP). The IPUMS-defined 1960 PUMA codes are unique across all states and do not have this requirement.</p>
            <p>The Census Bureau updates PUMA definitions with each decennial census, so PUMA codes may or may not identify consistent areas over longer periods of time. See the Comparability section for information about which PUMAs are used in each sample. See the Codes section for information about each set of PUMA definitions.</p>
            <p>Note: In some multi-year samples, PUMA definitions vary or are allocated In multi-year ACS/PRCS samples that span a PUMA definition change, the identified PUMAs vary based on the survey year when each respondent was interviewed (as given by MULTYEAR). This occurs in samples that span the change from 2000 PUMAs (survey years 2000-2011) to 2010 PUMAs (survey years 2012-2021) and in the 2022 5-year ACS/PRCS sample (which uses 2010 PUMAs for survey years 2018-2021 and 2020 PUMAs in 2022). With the 2023 5-year ACS/PRCS sample, the Census Bureau began reporting only 2020 PUMAs for all survey years, which they achieved by assigning pre-2022 respondents a 2020 PUMA based on their 2010 PUMAs of residence and the known relationships between 2010 and 2020 PUMAs. The Bureau has provided no details on their PUMA allocation method, but IPUMS has confirmed that it produces plausible population totals for the assigned 2020 PUMAs.</p>
            <p>In 1980 samples, "county groups" (CNTYGP98) are functionally similar to PUMAs with the same minimum population threshold of 100,000. In fact, "county group" is a misnomer because 1980 county groups, like PUMAs, typically subdivide large-population counties into smaller areas (though 1980 county groups still do not subdivide cities within counties as PUMAs do). In contrast, the county groups in 1970 samples (CNTYGP97) nearly all correspond to groups of one or more counties with a minimum population threshold of 250,000. In 1940 and 1950 samples, the identified geographic areas most like PUMAs are State Economic Areas (SEA).</p>

            <p>In all samples but 1960, PUMA codes are state-dependent. To uniquely identify all PUMAs in 1990 or later samples, the codes must be read in combination with one of the STATE variables: STATEFIP or STATEICP.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>The CPUMA0010 variable supplies codes for the 0010 version of ConsPUMAs (Consistent Public Use Microdata Areas). Each 0010 ConsPUMA is an aggregation of one or more 2010 U.S. Census PUMAs (Public Use Microdata Areas) that, in combination, align closely (within a 1% population mismatch tolerance) with a corresponding set of 2000 PUMAs.</p>
            <p>The 0010 ConsPUMAs are effectively the smallest geographic units that can be consistently identified from the geographic codes available in U.S. Census PUMS from 2000 to 2021 samples.</p>
            <p>See the 0010 ConsPUMA Geographic Tools page for boundary files and detailed composition tables.</p>
            <p>PUMAs and ConsPUMAs
PUMAs are the smallest geographic units identified in U.S. Census Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) since 1990. PUMA definitions are altered after each decennial census, so PUMA codes are not consistently comparable across time.</p>
            <p>To support spatio-temporal analysis of PUMS data, IPUMS defines ConsPUMAs as minimally aggregated sets of PUMAs that, when consolidated, align well across samples.</p>
            <p>Different versions of ConsPUMAs correspond to different vintages of PUMAs. The 0010 version represents areas that are consistent among 2000 and 2010 PUMAs.</p>
            <p>A separate variable, CONSPUMA, identifies sets of 1980 county groups and 1990 and 2000 PUMAs that comprise comparable populations for samples from 1980 through 2011.</p>
            <p>Construction Process and Mismatch Errors
To construct 0010 ConsPUMAs, we applied an aggregation algorithm that groups together 2010 PUMAs iteratively until the total population mismatch between each set of 2010 PUMAs and its closest matching set of 2000 PUMAs falls below 1% for both the 2000 and 2010 populations.</p>
            <p>Specifically, to compute mismatch errors, we first sum, for each intersection between 2000 and 2010 PUMAs, the populations of census blocks that have their center in the intersection according to 2010 Census TIGER/Line files. We then compute the percent omission error (the percent of 2010 PUMAs' population that resides outside of 2000 PUMAs) and percent commission error (the percent of 2000 PUMAs' population that resides outside of 2010 PUMAs) for each ConsPUMA. We sum these two statistics to obtain final mismatch scores.</p>
            <p>We compute mismatch separately for 2000 and 2010 populations in order to ensure that the mismatch between the 2000 and 2010 PUMAs associated with each ConsPUMA is acceptably small (below 1%) at both times.</p>
            <p>The CPUMA0010 Summary, available via the 0010 ConsPUMA Geographic Tools page, provides the mismatch errors for each ConsPUMA. That page also provides a 2000-2010 PUMA crosswalk file that includes the block-based 2000 and 2010 populations for each intersection between PUMAs.</p>
            <p>The algorithmic approach we use for 0010 ConsPUMAs differs from the process used to construct the original CONSPUMA variable. In that case, researchers visually inspected boundaries and "hand selected" ConsPUMA sets whose boundaries were closely (if not exactly) in alignment. The visual approach can ensure minimal levels of spatial mismatch, but small areas of mismatch may occasionally contain substantial populations, and large areas of mismatch may contain very small populations. Therefore, the visual approach may occasionally merge PUMAs unnecessarily or fail to merge PUMAs where the population mismatch is in fact large. In contrast, the new population-based algorithm is more consistent and reliable with respect to population mismatch.</p>
            <p>More information on the exact steps of the algorithm will be provided in a forthcoming paper.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>GQ classifies all housing units as falling into one of three main categories: households, group quarters, or vacant units. It also identifies fragmentary sample units for 1850-1930 (see below). In all years, the data available about a person and their co-residents depend on whether the person lives in a household or in group quarters. Households are sampled as units, meaning that everyone in the household is included in the sample, and most household-level variables are available. People living in group quarters are generally sampled as individuals; other people in their unit may or may not be included in the sample, and there is no way of linking co-residents' records to one another. If, however, a sampled person in group quarters was living with relatives, the related group was sampled for 1850-1930. Most household-level variables are not available for group quarters or for vacant units.</p>
            <p>Group quarters are largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder. See the comparability discussion below and "Sample Designs" for more details about changing definitions of group quarters.  Group-quarters types are identified in further detail by GQTYPE and GQFUNDS.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>RENT reports the amount of the household's monthly contract rent payment. For vacant units (included beginning in 1970), RENT reports the amount for which landlord expected to rent the unit. This amount includes utilities, fuels, etc. only if they were included in the rent contract. Respondents were to report the full contract amount, even if payments were delinquent or made by someone outside the household. See also RENTGRS.</p>
            <p>Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation. See INCTOT for Consumer Price Index adjustment factors. The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.</p>
            <p>User Note: The traditional unit of land area in Puerto Rico is the cuerda. The cuerda is equal to about 3930 square meters, 4700 square yards, or 0.971 acres. Because the cuerda and the acre are so close in size, they are often treated informally as being equal. Mainlanders sometimes call the cuerda the "Spanish Acre." The IPUMS has preserved the units for the mainland U.S. as acres and for Puerto Rico as cuerdas.</p>

            <p>User Note: Universe shifts and changing methods of determining value complicate use of this variable for comparisons across years. Furthermore, dollar amounts were intervalled differently for each year, and the top codes changed.

            <p>The Census Bureau released revised data for the 2008 and 2006-8 multiyear ACS in November 2010. The original releases erroneously assigned values of zero bedrooms for some missing values instead of imputing values for the number of bedrooms. Please seeACS Errata #54 and #64 for more information about the errors and the revisions. The revised releases correct this error. BEDROOMS reports these revised values.</p>
            <p>We provide the original values in BEDROOMSORIG so that users can analyze the differences in the revisions or replicate previous analyses. However, we recommend that users analyze the revised variable BEDROOMS in their research.</p>
            <p>User Note:
After removing the "not applicable" category (coded 00), to get the actual number of bedrooms, users must subtract 1 from the value of BEDROOMS.</p>

            <p>NFAMS is a constructed variable that counts the number of families within each unit. A "family" is any group of persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage. An unrelated individual is considered a separate family. Thus, a household consisting of a widow and her servant contains two families; a household consisting of a large, multiple-generation extended family with no boarders, lodgers, or servants counts as a single family.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>NSUBFAM indicates the number of subfamilies (if any) within the housing unit each person belongs.  All individuals who are not part of a subfamily, including all residents of group quarters, receive a code of 0.  See SUBFAM for a person-level variable identifying the members of each subfamily.  </p>
            <p>NSUBFAM is analogous to NFAMS in that it provides the number of family units within each household, but the specific family unit measured by each is different. NFAMS counts as one family all individuals who are related to the household head, whether or not they belong to a subfamily; NSUBFAM does not count household heads or their relatives unless they belong to a subfamily.  Additionally, NFAMS counts as separate family units all individuals who are unrelated to the head and who live without a spouse or children; NSUBFAM does not.  However, all unrelated subfamilies are counted as separate family units in both NFAMS and NSUBFAM.</p>
            <p>For more information on subfamilies and their measurement, see Subfamily Overview.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>PERWT indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample. </p>
            <p>It is generally a good idea to use PERWT when conducting a person-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of PERWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. PERWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for person-level analyses of any sample other than those.</p>
            <p>For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" and "Sample Weights". See also HHWT for a corresponding variable at the household level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 and 1950.</p>

            <h4>Coding Instructions</h4>
            <p>PERWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals. For example, a PERWT value of 010461 should be interpreted as 104.61. PERWT specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>The concept of race has changed over the more than 150 years represented in IPUMS. Currently, the Census Bureau and others consider race to be a sociopolitical construct, not a scientific or anthropological one. Many detailed RACE categories consist of national origin groups. With the exception of the 1970-1990 Puerto Rican censuses, RACE was asked of every person in all years. </p>
            <p>Beginning in 2000, the race question changed substantially to allow respondents to report as many races as they felt necessary to describe themselves. In earlier years, only one race response was coded. Beginning in 2020, the Census Bureau updated the questionnaire text, processing, and coding of the race and Hispanic origin questions, resulting in major changes to the distribution of race and Hispanic origin categories. As a result, users should proceed with caution when comparing RACE and HISPAN in 2019-prior samples with 2020-onward samples. More improvements made to the race question in 2020 were implemented in 2023. See the comparability tab for more details. </p>
            <p>IPUMS offers several variables describing the answer(s) to the race question. RACE provides the full detail given by the respondent and/or released by the Census Bureau; it is not always historically compatible (see comparability discussion below). Users primarily interested in historical compatibility should consider using RACHSING. RACHSING codes race and Hispanic origin responses into a simple, historically compatible scheme that includes only federally defined race and Hispanic origin groups. Please note that RACESING, an earlier version of RACHSING, is also available on the IPUMS website. </p>
            <p>In addition, specific combinations of major races can be discerned using the following bivariate indicators of whether a particular race group was reported: RACAMIND, RACASIAN, RACBLK, RACOTHER, RACPACIS, and RACWHT. RACNUM indicates the total number of major race groups reported for an individual. The information contained in the bivariate indicators and in RACNUM is integrated into the detailed version of RACE. </p>
            <p>Prior to 1960, the census enumerator was responsible for categorizing persons and was not specifically instructed to ask the individual his or her race. In 1970 and later years, an individual's race was reported by someone in the household or group quarters. In the 1990 U.S. census, the 2000 U.S. and Puerto Rican censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS respondents were specifically asked what race the person "considers himself/herself" to be, although such self-description was more or less operative since 1960.</p>
            <p>User Note: Race questions were not asked in the Puerto Rican censuses of 1970, 1980, and 1990.  They were asked in the 1910 and 1920 Puerto Rican censuses, the 2000-2010 Puerto Rican censuses, and the PRCS.</p>

            <p>HISPAN identifies persons of Hispanic/Spanish/Latino origin and classifies them according to their country of origin when possible. Origin is defined by the Census Bureau as ancestry, lineage, heritage, nationality group, or country of birth. People of Hispanic origin may be of any race; see RACE for a discussion of coding issues involved.  Users should note that race questions were not asked in the Puerto Rican censuses of 1970, 1980 and 1990.  They were asked in the 1910 and 1920 Puerto Rican censuses, and in the 2000 and 2010 Puerto Rican census and the PRCS.  However, questions assessing Spanish/Hispanic origin were not asked in the Puerto Rican censuses prior to 2000. </p>
            <p>The HISPAN general code covers country-of-origin classifications common to all years; the detailed code distinguishes additional groups and subgroups. See HISPRULE for details on how country of origin information was assigned prior to 1980. </p>
            <p>In 2020, the Census Bureau updated the questionnaire text, processing, and coding of the race and Hispanic origin questions, resulting in major changes to the distribution of race and Hispanic origin categories. As a result, users should proceed with caution when comparing HISPAN and RACE in 2019-prior samples with 2020-onward samples. See the comparability tab for more details.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>INCTOT reports each respondent's total pre-tax personal income or losses from all sources for the previous year. The censuses collected information on income received from these sources during the previous calendar year; for the ACS and the PRCS, the reference period was the past 12 months. Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation:</p>
            <p>Users studying change over time must adjust for inflation. Consumer Price Index adjustment factors for the appropriate years can be found in the CPI99 variable.</p>
            <p>The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.</p>
            <p>User Note: ACS respondents are surveyed throughout the year, and amounts do not reflect calendar year dollars. While the Census Bureau provides an adjustment factor (available in ADJUST), this is an imperfect solution. See the ACS income variables note for further details.</p>
            <p>For a more complete discussion of the use of these factors to adjust for inflation, users may wish to see the IPUMS-CPS note on adjusting dollar amount variables for inflation.</p>
