# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze the extent to which demographic changes in the U.S. population can account for changes in average American household size since 2000. The methodology, based upon [Galster (2024)](#galster2024), is to construct a multidimensional matrix, with each cell representing a unique combination of demographic (age, sex, race, etc) and geographic (PUMA) characteristics. The value in each cell represents the average household size among persons with that characteristic in the year 2000. The methodology is then applied to data from the year 2020 to determine which demographic groups have the largest changes.

The project uses American Community Survey (ACS) IPUMS microdata, which are freely available to the public after registering for an API key.

# Project Setup

TODO: set up an R project so the renv and working directory load up automatically upon opening the project.

## If you're running the code for the first time...

1. Sign up for an IPUMS account and API key

2. Clone the repository

3. Set your working directory into the repository:

    Shell:
    
    ```sh
    cd your/path/to/household-size
    ```
    
    R:
    
    ```r
    setwd("your/path/to/household-size")
    ```

4. Add a step to check if `renv` package is already installed and install if necessary?

5. Download and install all the needed packages using `renv` ([R virtual environment](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html))

    TODO: Do you need to run `renv::activate()` first? I'm not sure.

    ```r
    renv::restore()
    ```

5. Run the main script

6. View results

## If you're running the code any subsequent time...

1. Set your working directory into the repository:

    Shell:
    
    ```sh
    cd your/path/to/household-size
    ```
    
    R:
    
    ```r
    setwd("your/path/to/household-size")
    ```

2. Restore the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

    ```r
    renv::restore()
    ```

3. Run the main script

# FAQ

1. How granular is this analysis, geographically?

    There are XXX Census PUMAs in the United States. However, their size varies widely. In the state of Ohio, the smallest PUMA encompasses [what city?] and the largest PUMA encompasses [the rest of the state?]

    [map of Ohio PUMAs]

    Here's a map of the PUMAs in the United States.

    [map of all PUMAs]

2. How granular is this analysis, demographically?

    The variables we use to bin individuals into groups are the following. See our codebook [link to codebook] for more information.

    **Age**: 5-year bins:
        - 0-4 years
        - 5-9 years
        - 10-14 years
        - 15-19 years
        - 20-24 years
        - 25-29 years
        - 30-24 years
        - ...
        - 75-79 years
        - 80-84 years
        - 85+

    [perhaps a table of how many individuals fall in each age group?]

    **Race**: Add info here

    **Household income**: Add information here on how it's defined, whether it's pre-tax/transfer, whether it's only earned or earned and unearned, how it's deflated to compare over time, etc.
