The purpose of this project is to analyze the extent to which demographic changes in the U.S. population can account for changes in average American household size since 2000. The methodology, based upon Galster (2024), is to construct a multidimensional matrix, with each cell representing a unique combination of demographic (age, sex, race, etc) and geographic (PUMA) characteristics. The value in each cell represents the average household size among persons with that characteristic in the year 2000. The methodology is then applied to data from the year 2020 to determine which demographic groups have the largest changes.

The project uses of American Community Survey (ACS) IPUMS microdata, which are freely available to the public after registering for an API key.
