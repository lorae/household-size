Let:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(P\) = \textbf{Total population size}
\item
  \(H\) = \textbf{Number of households}
\item
  \(M_p\) = \textbf{Person-level mean household size}

  For every person \(j\) in a population \(P\) living in a household of
  \(m_j\) members, the \textbf{person-level} mean household size is a
  simple average across person-level observations:

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1}
    \tag{1}
    M_p = \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^H m_j^2}{P}
    \end{equation}
\item
  \(M_h\) = \textbf{Household-level mean household size}

  The \textbf{household-level} mean household size is a simple average
  across households as individual observations:

  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:2}
    \tag{2}
    M_h = \frac{P}{H}
    \end{align}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{context}{%
\section{Context}\label{context}}

Equation \eqref{eq:2} shows that household-level mean household size and
population is adequate to deduce the number of households. However,
person-level household size does not lend itself to this equivalency:
the same person-level mean and population can be consistent with
multiple values for the number of households.

Figure 1.2 illustrates this point in a hypothetical population with
\(P = 6\) and \(M_p = 3\). In Scenario 1, average person-level household
size is \(\frac{3^2 + 3^2}{6} = 3\) and there are 2 households. In
Scenario 2, average person-level household size is
\(\frac{1^2 + 1^2 + 4^2}{6} = 3\) and there are 3 households. Thus,
population and person-level household size alone do not singularly
determine the number of households.

There is a range of possible number of households \(H\) consistent with
a known population size \(P\) and person-level average household size
\(M_p\). The range on \(H\) is bounded by a minumum of

\begin{align}
H_{min} = \frac{P}{M_p}
\end{align}

and a maximum of

\hypertarget{lemma-1-minimum-number-of-households}{%
\section{Lemma 1: Minimum Number of
Households}\label{lemma-1-minimum-number-of-households}}

The minimum number of households consistent with a population size \(P\)
and person-level average household size \(M_p\) is: \begin{align}
H_{\min} = \frac{P}{M_p}
\end{align}

\hypertarget{proof}{%
\subsection{Proof}\label{proof}}

Suppose the population \(P\) is distributed into \(H\) households with
the measured household size in the \(j\)th household equal to \(m_j\).
As defined above, \textbf{person-level} mean household size is:

\begin{equation}
M_p = \frac{1}{P}\sum_{j = 1}^H m_j^2
\end{equation}

Any configuration of \(P\) individuals across households can be
transformed into any other configuration through a finite sequence of
single-person transfers. The initial count of households, \(H\), need
not match the final count of households, \(H'\): we conceptualize a
`reservoir' of zero-person households to account for changes between
\(H\) and \(H'\). Forming a new household can be conceptualized as
moving an individual to a zero-person household, which remains uncounted
unless populated. Conversely, a household can be dissolved by moving all
of its members to other households, thus turning a household with a
positive number of members into a zero-person household. For example, in
Figure 1.2, once can incrementally create Scenario 2 after starting from
Scenario 1 through the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Move one individual from Household A to a newly formed Household C.
\item
  Move another individual from Household A to Household C.
\item
  Move two individuals from Household B to Household C.
\end{enumerate}

Next, we calculate how the person-level mean household size changes
after a single-person transfer. Suppose we begin with an arbitrary
configuration of \(P\) individuals in \(H\) households, with each
household \(m_j\) containing some whole number of members
\(m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{H-1}, m_H\). We move one individual from
household \(j = k\) to household \(j = k+1\). Then mean household size
changes from:

\begin{equation}
M_p =\frac{1}{P} \bigg( \sum_{j = 1}^{k-1} m_j^2 + m_k^2 + m_{k+1}^2 +  \sum_{j = k+2}^{H}m_j^2 \bigg)
\end{equation}

to

\begin{equation}
M_p' =\frac{1}{P} \bigg( \sum_{j = 1}^{k-1} m_j'^2 + m_k'^2 + m_{k+1}'^2 + \sum_{j = k+2}^{H}m_j'^2 \bigg)
\end{equation}

Person-level household size increases if \(M_p' - M_p > 0\), remains the
same if \(M_p' - M_p = 0\), and shrinks if \(M_p' - M_p < 0\). Since all
household sizes \(m_j = m_j'\) are unaffected by the shift, aside from
the special case of \(j = k\) and \(j = k+1\), the remaining terms
cancel out due to equivalence.

\begin{align}
M_p' - M_p & = \frac{1}{P} \bigg( \sum_{j = 1}^{k-1} m_j^2 + m_k^2 + m_{k+1}^2 +  \sum_{j = k+2}^{H}m_j^2 \bigg) - \frac{1}{P} \bigg( \sum_{j = 1}^{k-1} m_j'^2 + m_k'^2 + m_{k+1}'^2 + \sum_{j = k+2}^{H}m_j'^2 \bigg) \\
\label{eq:3}
\tag{3}
& = \frac{1}{P} \bigg( (m_k^2 + m_{k+1}^2) - (m_k'^2 + m_{k+1}'^2) \bigg) \\
\end{align}

We now transition to exploring how the value \(M_p' - M_p\) varies under
each of the three circumstances:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(m_{k+1} = m_k - 1\)
\item
  \(m_{k+1} < m_k - 1\)
\item
  \(m_{k+1} > m_k - 1\)
\end{enumerate}

Reiterate the minima and maxima, take it back to the example at the
